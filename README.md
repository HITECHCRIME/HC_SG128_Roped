bricking squad means no death toll
both outlyers've flown
to contradict to be conned
with verdicts beyond reach

all i said was trust him
now i would have taken pull

supplia ARE ALL GONE 
GOAL GANG, GO GET IT ON

got it all right then 
totally would have gotten odd 
the fact is but i'd rather say no
stick it in the pocket 
for survival, fake it unda breath 
last step, dig it up graveyard                     (what happens)  WRAP UP,

suck it up braveheart

## Notes

## Music Video

Roped - Hitech Crime cyberpunk term, getting scammed on tech. Scene at a hitech tech pawn shop. Faulty unit.
Towards the end in the music video we tear up cyberpunk pawnshop coz we got “roped” (name of the song)/scammed on some expensive hitech equipment.
